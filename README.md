#Breast Cancer Diagnosis Classifier

In this repository, you'll find a machine learning project that focuses on breast cancer diagnosis classification. We've built a robust classifier using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to determine whether a breast tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on various tumor characteristics.

Our project includes:

- A comprehensive dataset of tumor features, including radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, and more.
- A well-documented Jupyter notebook that walks you through the data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- Code to generate insightful visualizations to aid in understanding the data and model performance.
- Detailed explanations of the machine learning techniques and decisions made during the project.
- A trained SVM classifier that can be used to predict tumor diagnoses on new data.

Whether you're interested in breast cancer research, machine learning, or data analysis, this repository provides valuable insights and a practical example of a tumor diagnosis classifier. Join us in the fight against breast cancer by exploring, contributing, or using our classifier for your own research or applications.
